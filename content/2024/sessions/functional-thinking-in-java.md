Functional programming is on the rise. Moving to functional programming can result in significantly better code and productivity gains. However, it requires a paradigm shift: you need to move away from imperative and object-oriented thinking to start thinking functionally. Thatâ€™s what this workshop will help you achieve: it will help you make your shift towards functional programming. The workshop will introduce lambda functions in Java with examples from Java library itself.
