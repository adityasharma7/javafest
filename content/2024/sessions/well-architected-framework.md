Imagine building a new system on the cloud or migrating an existing one to the cloud. How do you instil confidence in your customers that their data is secure? Can your architecture handle a spike in traffic if a media report goes viral? Can your architecture handle the failure of one or more critical components? Are you using resources most efficiently?
The Azure Well-Architected Framework helps you to design, build, and continuously improve a secure, reliable, and efficient application. This talk introduces you to the framework, pillars and principles essential to a great Azure architecture.
