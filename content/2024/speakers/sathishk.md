As a seasoned software architect with expertise in building modern, cloud-native applications, I am well-versed in utilizing open source technologies for both consumption and contribution. I am a firm believer in the power of knowledge sharing and actively engage in speaking at meetups and conferences worldwide to foster a collaborative learning environment. My approach to software development emphasizes continuous delivery, test-driven development (TDD), design systems, user experience (UX), and modern engineering practices to ensure the production of high-quality software. Additionally, I am committed to promoting free education and take initiatives to contribute towards making this vision a reality. With a passion for staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends and advancements, I strive to bring innovation and excellence to my work and contribute positively to the software development community.
