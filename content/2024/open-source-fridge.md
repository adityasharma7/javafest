title: 'Open Source Fridge: Empowering Job Seekers During Recession through Open Source Contributions'
---

Recessions leave a lasting impact, particularly for those who have experienced the challenges of previous economic downturns like the ones in 2001 and 2008. The pain of job loss and the struggle of securing the first job can be incredibly difficult to forget. While the market eventually recovers, the impact on freshers and experienced professionals can lead to a loss of confidence, causing many to step away from the industry during these trying times.

To address this pressing issue, we present the "Open Source Fridge" campaignâ€”an innovative solution aimed at empowering job seekers during recessionary periods. Drawing inspiration from a refrigerator that keeps vegetables fresh until they are used for cooking, this campaign focuses on providing opportunities for freshers and experienced individuals impacted by the recession.

The Open Source Fridge initiative revolves around creating a collaborative environment where job seekers can actively contribute to selected open-source projects. By participating in these projects, participants not only gain valuable experience and skill development but also receive stipends and experience letters to enhance their employability.

Join us in this transformative campaign to support job seekers affected by recession. Together, we can provide a platform for individuals to stay connected to the industry, maintain their skills, and boost their confidence until the market returns to normalcy. Let us create an Open Source Fridge that preserves the talent and potential of job seekers, ensuring their resilience and continuous growth in the face of economic challenges.
