Application Observability has emerged as a hot topic in the software development community, presenting a paradigm shift in monitoring and understanding complex systems. While traditionally, the responsibility for implementing observability fell on developers, recent developments have witnessed frameworks incorporating built-in support for this crucial feature.

As you know Observability is the ability to understand the state of a system from the outside. It is essential for troubleshooting problems, identifying performance bottlenecks, and ensuring the reliability of applications. Spring Boot provides a number of features that make it easy to implement observability in your applications.

In this talk, we will discuss the following topics:

    What is observability?
    Why is observability important?
    How to implement observability in Spring Boot applications
    Tools and frameworks for observability
    Best practices for observability
