As a Director of Engineering at HotWax Commerce, I am leading the team that is building a digital experiences platform for omnichannel retail solutions with an idea to provide a great experience to enterprise customers and consumers. 

In my current role, I: 
1. Design and architect technical solutions for enterprise grade mobile apps.
2. Give technical guidance to the team of software engineers.
3. Ensure timely delivery of sprints without compromising software development best practices and product quality. 
4. Build a team of engineers and mentor them to grow in their careers. 
5. Collaborate with Product Managers, Business Analysts, and Engineering Leads to ensure that the apps we build delight our customers. 
I also love to code myself and lead by example.

Love contributing to the Open source and spreading the word about it.
